SpreeDatashiftProdImport
========================

This spree extension allows admin to import Products, Variants, Users, Orders etc using a CSV file including all associations. This also supports import of Products through a .xls file.

Installation
------------

1. Add following to your Gemfile:

  ```ruby
  gem 'spree_datashift_prod_import', github: 'vinsol-spree-contrib/spree_datashift_prod_import', branch: <spree-version-compatible>
  gem 'datashift_spree', github: 'vinsol-spree-contrib/datashift_spree', branch: '3-2-stable'
  gem 'datashift', github: 'vinsol-spree-contrib/datashift', branch: '3-2-stable'
  ```
  *The `branch` option is important:* it must match the version of Spree you're using. For example, use `3-1-stable` if you're using Spree `3-1-stable` or any `3.1.x` version.

2. Install the gem using Bundler:

  ```ruby
  bundle install
  ```

3. Copy & run migrations

  ```ruby
  bundle exec rails g spree_datashift_prod_import:install
  ```

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
